# Code Readme

## sensorCollection.c - Ritam Das
The ESP32 reads from two different sensors (the thermistor and accelerometer) and outputs to one LED based on led intensity inputted by user on the node server. Code was adapted from skill 13 (thermistor), skill 23 (accelerometer), and skill 24 (PWM to control LED).
